## Features

- Create world with customizable settings (e.g seed, difficulty, etc).
- Modify Existing World Settings (e.g, difficulty, PvP, etc.).
- Teleport between world.
- Load/unload existing world.
- List loaded worlds.
- Disable invalid world names (e.g, "plugins")
- Strong addons system 

And that's all. This plugin does exactly what you want from a multiverse and world manager pluginâ€”NOTHING MORE. No dozens of useless and unwanted features, and literally 0 EventHandlers.

## Addons

BulMultiverse is designed to be light and efficient by default, but if you need additional features, you can extend its functionality with addons. These small, optional addons can be placed in the /addons folder (within the folder bulmultiverse) to enable specific features without bloating the plugin. This ensures that your server stays as lightweight as possible, only running the features you actually need. More about addons here
